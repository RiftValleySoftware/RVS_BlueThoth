*Version 1.0.5.0000* **April 21, 2020**
- Removed the Data extension, because it's sort of unsafe, and probably not something that should be in a public utility.

*Version 1.0.4.0000* **April 21, 2020**
- Added the Data extension, and the casting function.

*Version 1.0.3.0000* **April 20, 2020**
- Some basic refactoring to improve "swiftiness."

*Version 1.0.2.0000* **April 19, 2020**
- Added the uuidFormat computed property.

*Version 1.0.1.0000* **January 31, 2020**
- Very minor tweak to the MD5/SHA routines, to make them a tiny bit more efficient.
- Removed the Pods project from the workspace (I don't like to ship with pods -I only use them for the SwiftLint).

*Version 1.0.0.0000* **January 29, 2020**
- Initial Release.
