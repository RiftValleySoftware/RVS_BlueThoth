This is a Bluetooth SDK for "Central" (Client) Core Bluetooth (BLE) implementation.

It abstracts some of the more "tedious" aspects of using Core Bluetooth; allowing the app to easily implement a Bluetooth Client functionality.

[This is the GitHub repo for this project.](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_BlueThoth) It is 100% open-source, MIT-licensed code.
